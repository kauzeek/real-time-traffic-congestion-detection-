# real-time-traffic-congestion-detection-
This project utilizes the YOLOv3 deep learning model to detect and analyze traffic congestion in real-time through video feeds. The system aims to improve urban traffic management by providing accurate, fast, and intelligent congestion detection using computer vision.

🚦 Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion is a growing issue due to increasing population and vehicle usage. Traditional methods of traffic monitoring are manual, inefficient, and fail to scale with rising demand. This project addresses this by leveraging deep learning and computer vision to develop an automated, real-time traffic analysis solution.
